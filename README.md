# A movie review application

## Overview

The application fetches movies from a [movie API] (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Only logged in users can see them, and they are the ones who can write reviews as well. The reviews can be searched by movie and by reviewer. The application is responsive.

It was a team project, in which I was mainly responsible for the backend.

## Technologies

The project was created using:

- React.js
- Node.js
